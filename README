GTK2 Compatibility Package

Compatibility Wrapper for GTK+2

Wrapper for pkg-config file and M4 macros, which simulates presence of
GTK+2, but tries to use GTK+3.

Using it instead of GTK+2 development files allows to force linking of
some applications with new libraries without any effort.


Usage:

Simply replace old devel packages by gtk2-compat in your system.
Programs will be compiled with GTK+2, if possible.

Don't expect that you will be able to compile all projects!
